This is a desktop version of the AndEngine multiplayer example. This version of the server periodically broadcasts a moveFace message to all the connected clients, the move position is random. 

Use the supplied android client (apk file) as there is a minor change to the original example from the AndEngine example repository. The example was modified to create a face incase we receive a moveFace message and are unable to find it.
